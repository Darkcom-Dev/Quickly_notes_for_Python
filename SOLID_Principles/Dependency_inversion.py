# Reversal dependancy

"""
The dependency must be in abstractions, not in concretions.
The modules of high level must be not depend of low level modules.
So much the low level classes like high level classes should depend
of the same abstractions.
The abstractions not should depend of the details.
The details should depend of abstractions

Arrive a point in the software development in that our applications is

When this happens, we must clarify the things using dependency inyection.
